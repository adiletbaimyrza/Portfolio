        Hello everyone! As I prepare to start my final year at the University of Lodz,
        I am actively seeking entry-level Software Engineering positions.
        Currently, I am working on personal projects, primarily using C++ and Python.
        Aside from programming, I am also gearing up for the upcoming Autumn marathons season in Poland.
        I approach both of my passions, running and coding, with the same concepts of agility,
        adaptability, and ongoing self-improvement.
    </p>
